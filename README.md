[Visit the project homepage](http://mineways.com) for executables for PC and Mac, documentation links, credits, etc.
Much of the mapping and UI code is built on the open-source project [Minutor](http://seancode.com/minutor/).

There are different major versions of Mineways. You usually want the latest version; version 1.15 can be used on older worlds.
* **Version 5.** works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.9 and beyond, adds scripting language.
* **Version 4.** works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.9-ish and beyond, 64-bit for large exports.
* **Version 3.** works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.7 worlds (Anvil, stair geometry changes, and new texturing).
* **Version 2.x** works on Minecraft 1.2 worlds to 1.4 (Anvil format).
* **Version 1.x** works on Minecraft 1.1 worlds and earlier (McRegion format).

Source files are here:

* **Win/** contains the Windows version of Mineways (in C++).
* **TileMaker/** contains the TileMaker for Mineways, which takes the individual block textures and forms a terrainExt.png file for use by Mineways. This allows you to replace any terrain textures with your own custom tiles.

Compiling
--------------

* Windows - You can compile this with Visual Studio
Open Mineways.sln in Visual C++, switch the target to Release and x64, compile the solution to
		`generate Mineways.exe`

Sorry, other platforms are not directly supported, though Mineways runs fine under [WINE](http://www.winehq.org/) and we also provide a Mac-specific version.

If you want to work on the mapping part of this program on another platform, see [Minutor](http://seancode.com/minutor/), which *is* supported on Mac and Linux.
