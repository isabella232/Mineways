Region File Format

Concept: The minimum unit of storage on hard drives is 4KB. 90% of Minecraft
chunks are smaller than 4KB. 99% are smaller than 8KB. Write a simple
container to store chunks in single files in runs of 4KB sectors.

Each region file represents a 32x32 group of chunks. The conversion from
chunk number to region number is floor(coord / 32); a chunk at (30, -3)
would be in region (0, -1), and one at (70, -30) would be at (3, -1).
Region files are named "r.x.z.mcr", where x and z are the region coordinates.

A region file begins with an 8KB header that describes where chunks are stored
in the file and when they were last modified. A 4-byte big-endian integer 
represents sector offsets and sector counts. The chunk offset for a chunk 
located at (x, z) begins at byte 4*(x+z*32) in the file. The bottom byte of 
the chunk offset indicates the number of sectors the chunk takes up,and 
the top 3 bytes represent the sector number of the chunk. Given a chunk
offset o, the chunk data begins at byte 4096*(o/256) and takes up at 
most 4096*(o%256) bytes. A chunk cannot exceed 1MB in size. A chunk offset 
of 0 indicates a missing chunk.

The 4-byte big-endian modification time for a chunk (x,z) begins at byte 
4096+4*(x+z*32) in the file. The time is stored as the number of seconds
since Jan 1, 1970 that the chunk was last written (aka Unix Time).

Chunk data begins with a 4-byte big-endian integer representing the chunk data
length in bytes, not counting the length field. The length must be smaller than
4096 times the number of sectors. The next byte is a version number, to allow
backwards-compatible updates to how chunks are encoded.

A version number of 1 is never used, for obscure historical reasons.

A version number of 2 represents a deflated (zlib compressed) NBT file. The 
deflated data is the chunk length - 1.
