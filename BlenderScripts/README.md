## How to Use ##

To use the script within Blender, for use with the Cycles renderer:

Open Blender and import the obj file created by Mineways.

Change any window to the text editor.
Alternatively, Go to the top of the window where it says "Default", click on the screen layout button left to the word "Default" and pick "Scripting".

Click "Open" at the bottom of the text window.
Go to the directory where this file, "CyclesMineways.py", is and select it.
You should now see some text in the text window.
Alternatively, you can also paste in the text.

To apply this script, click on the "Run Script" button at the bottom of the text window.

OPTIONAL:
To see that the script's print output, you may want to turn on the terminal/console.
It is not critical to see this window, but it might give you a warm and fuzzy feeling to know that the script has worked.
It also helps provide debug info if something goes wrong.

For Windows:
From the upper left of your window select "Window" and then "Toggle System Console".

For OS X:
Find your application, right click it, hit "Show Package Contents".
Navigate to Contents/MacOS/blender
Launch blender this way, this will show the terminal.

Run Blender through the terminal.
