PREFIX now no longer needs to be set
  If you have imported 2 or more minecraft .obj files, or you are importing into a big .blend file,
    you still need to set the PREFIX or the scipt might get confused

Stained Glass now makes the shadow it casts its own color
  There is now a constant you can change to say how much of the light should be colored
